The coding challenge has 3 challenges in it.  
1) The 1st challenge, in the stealthwatch.problemone package, is to walk a graph of GNodes.  The GNode interface was a GNode array.  I would have preferred a Collection/List/or set depending. I wrote a test to ensure that it worked.
2) The 2nd challenge,in the stealthwatch.problemtwo package, is to determine all of the paths that lead to leaves in a tree as represented in an ArrayList.  
3) The 3rd challenge, in the file called problem-three-file-word-count.sh, counts the occurrence of each word in a text file.  I chose bash as most of the infrastructue was already there to be able to do that and a quick google search turneed up a simple straightforward solution.
